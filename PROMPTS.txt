PROMPT 1:


You are a developer,you need to implement the below


A.Create 4 agents:


Agent 1- get an english sentence and translate it to french
Agent 2- get a french sentence and translate it to hebrew
Agent 3- get a hebrew sentence and translate it to english
Agent 4- create a random sentence (15 words) in english and save it as “input sentence”, then use agent 1  , then use agent 2 on the results , then use agent 3 on the results and save it as “output sentence”. 


B. Write a python code that:
1. Run the below in a loop 100 times or until vectorial distance>0.5:
   1. Run agent 4 
   2. get the 2 strings returned by agent 4 and calc the vectorial distance between them, save the vectorial distance  in a list called “vectorial distance list”
   3. Add the input sentence, output sentence and vector distance to a results.csv under results folder (create results folder and results.csv if not yet exist
2. From the vectorial distance list, display in a graph the vectorial distances by index, beside the mean and variance of the values
3. Save the graph it results folder 


PROMPT 2:  


can you update the code so for each run, a new results docs will be created




PROMPT 3:  


can you update the script to have the stopping condition distance used in
"if distance > X:" as parameter, and also display the stopping condition 
distance for each run next to the mean and variance in the graph
